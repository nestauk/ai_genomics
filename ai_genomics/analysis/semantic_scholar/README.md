# Semantic Scholar

## Overview

[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) is a platform / tool that uses AI to advance scientific discovery.

This includes programmatic / bulk access to a corpus of research articles enriched in various ways.

- [This paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Construction-of-the-Literature-Graph-in-Semantic-Ammar-Groeneveld/649def34f8be52c8b66281af98ae884c09aef38b) describes the construction of the corpus.
- Data can be bulk downloaded [here](https://api.semanticscholar.org/corpus/download/)
- It is also possible to search / query the data with this [API](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api)
  - NB that the API is severely rate-limited. Semantic Scholar provide access to a faster API but we would have to explain the project and wait for their permission (which can take some time)

## Data provenance and quality

`We obtain metadata and PDF files of papers via partnerships with publishers (e.g., Springer, Nature), catalogs (e.g., DBLP, MEDLINE), pre-publishing services (e.g., arXiv, bioRxive), as well as web-crawling`

- This [paper](https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/undergradsymposium/2022/posters/23/) assesses paper de-duplication in Semantic Scholar

It is also possible to obtain...

- The citations received by a paper
- The citations that a paper has made
- A SPECTER vector representation of the paper
- ...

## Further questions

- How does the semantic scholar bulk download compare with OpenAlex? One advantage in OpenAlex is that it contains information about institutions matchable with GRID.
- How does SS compare with other scientometric databases? It seems to have very good coverage of software engineering and other technological subjects, but what about genomics, medicine and biology?

## Role in the project

- Semantic Scholar could help us to enrich paper data with citation information either as...
  - counts: how many citations do papers in different topics or from different institutions receive?
  - How many "high impact papers" (cited by highly cited papers / institutions) are generated by different topics and institutions? Which areas are showing more "velocity" in their influence?
  - networks: do AI + genomics paper cite more / less from specific disciplines and communities compared to a benchmark?
- We could also use the specter embeddings of papers available from SS to cluster them into topics / themes
