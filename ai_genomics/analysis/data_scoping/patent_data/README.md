## Conversation with Karlis

Innovation Sweet Spots 2 will be using a source called [Patsnap Analytics](https://www.patsnap.com/solutions/life-sciences/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Brand+EMEA&utm_term=patsnap%20analytics&utm_content=583985439488&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxtSSBhDYARIsAEn0thSul559c13TJ1eG14zl7y1C7rVGN1KqYHviiHOet66ShIt3VmVca-AaAjJDEALw_wcB). 

From Karlis:

```
In terms of patent data:
Discovery has purchased access to the PatSnap Analytics platform. 
In brief, we decided to save some time and go for quick insights using 
this platform - and then if we see that they resonate with our 
stakeholders,we will think if we want to find resources to adopt 
some open source data instead.
They have good coverage (patent offices across the world), 
you can get the location of the patent holder, and they also have 
a rough estimate of the â€˜market valueâ€™ of the patent in USD which is interesting. 
The patent search and selection happens primarily with keyword queries.
