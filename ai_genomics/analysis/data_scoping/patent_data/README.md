## Conversation with Karlis

Innovation Sweet Spots 2 will be using a source called [Patsnap Analytics](https://www.patsnap.com/solutions/life-sciences/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Brand+EMEA&utm_term=patsnap%20analytics&utm_content=583985439488&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxtSSBhDYARIsAEn0thSul559c13TJ1eG14zl7y1C7rVGN1KqYHviiHOet66ShIt3VmVca-AaAjJDEALw_wcB). 

From Karlis:

```
In terms of patent data:
Discovery has purchased access to the PatSnap Analytics platform. 
In brief, we decided to save some time and go for quick insights using 
this platform - and then if we see that they resonate with our 
stakeholders,we will think if we want to find resources to adopt 
some open source data instead.
They have good coverage (patent offices across the world), 
you can get the location of the patent holder, and they also have 
a rough estimate of the â€˜market valueâ€™ of the patent in USD which is interesting. 
The patent search and selection happens primarily with keyword queries.
```

## The role patent data could have in this project

* We could identify patent documents as AI genomics-related if its title, abstract or claims matched at least X AI-genomics keyword(s), or it was assigned at least one of the AI or genomics patent classificaion codes. Depending on the data source(s) we end up using, we could also try Google's semi-supervised patent landscaping approach, which uses uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) artificial neural networks and a pre-built word2vec word embedding model trained on ~6 million patent abstracts.  We would first need to identify a seed set of ai-genomics patents. We could two step it and 1) use a keyword approach to identify a seed set of patents then 2) use this semi-supervised patent approach (although unclear if we would get many more results not already capture by a purely keyword approach)     
* Instead of trying to identify patents related to the interaction between AI and genomics, we could also take a "top down" approach of first either identifying 1) AI patents (or just use USPTO's AI patents data) or 2) identifying genomics patents then identifying 1) genomics patents within AI patents or 2) AI related patents within genomics patents. 
* We could also i.e. embed then cluster ai genomics patent data to identify different topics within the area. 
* Once we identfy relevant patents, we could take advantange of i.e. Patent Lens's existing graphs of [patents, citations and institutions](https://www.lens.org/lens/patcite) by querying their graph with ai-genomics patent ids. If needed, we could potentially enrich the citation data with info from i.e. semantic scholar.
