## CrunchBase

Run `python ai_genomics/analysis/crunchbase_definitions.py` to test the impact of different definition strategies on the results. Data are fetched from S3 but not stored locally.

Run `python ai_genomics/analysis/gtr_definitions.py` to print a summary of AI / genomics projects in the GtR data. This also saves a list of project in the intersection of AI and genomics in `inputs/data/gtr/gtr_ai_genomics_projects.json`.
