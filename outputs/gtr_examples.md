But genes are more complicated than we thought. It seems that genes can be transformed: somewhere between the DNA code for a gene and the final protein, genes can be 'spliced' to make different types of proteins and to form other molecules that interact with the gene system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Improving The Longevity Of New Infectious Disease Therapeutics Using Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence In Early Stage Drug Discovery | Drugs against diseases caused by viruses, bacteria and parasites have transformed human health and saved millions of lives. Nevertheless, their widespread use and misuse has led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that poses a potentially catastrophic threat to public health. The increasing power of genomic sequencing is offering new ways to rapidly detect and respond to the development of antimicrobial resistance. The availability of this wealth of data, along with the latest developments in artificial intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) techniques, allows the development of sophisticated approaches that can fully leverage this data to pre-empt the effects of potential re... |
