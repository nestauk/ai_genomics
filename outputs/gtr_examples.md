| Deep Learning for Behavioural Genomics                                                                                                        | Microbiota present a promising and underexploited potential source of novel neuroactive compounds for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disease in humans. However, due to their diverse and complex interactions with the host nervous system, identifying causal strains and the molecules they produce remains challenging. Here, I address this challenge in the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, as it is a simple bacterivore with a small nervous system, yet displays a variety of bacteria-influenced behaviours that are observable in the laboratory and governed by conserved neural signalling pathways. I perform phenotypic screening and animal tracking to investigate the behavioural re... |
| Deriving an actionable patient phenome from healthcare data                                                                                   | Translating routinely collected health data into knowledge is a requirement of a &quot;learning health system&quot;. Since joining the Biomedical Research Centre at the South London and Maudsley Hospital, Kings College London, my research has been focused on developing 'CogStack and SemEHR'. This is an integrated health informatics platform which aims to to unlock unstructured health records and assist in clinical decision making and research. The system does much to surface the deep data within the NHS, for example through providing a patient-centric search on semantically annotated clinical notes to support studies such as the recruitment of patients for Genomics England's 100,000 Genomes ... |
| Improving The Longevity Of New Infectious Disease Therapeutics Using Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence In Early Stage Drug Discovery | Drugs against diseases caused by viruses, bacteria and parasites have transformed human health and saved millions of lives. Nevertheless, their widespread use and misuse has led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that poses a potentially catastrophic threat to public health. The increasing power of genomic sequencing is offering new ways to rapidly detect and respond to the development of antimicrobial resistance. The availability of this wealth of data, along with the latest developments in artificial intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) techniques, allows the development of sophisticated approaches that can fully leverage this data to pre-empt the effects of potential re... |
| Investigating RNA regulation during embryonic and germline development in zebrafish                                                           | This MRC-funded doctoral training partnership (DTP) brings together cutting-edge molecular and analytical sciences with innovative computational approaches in data analysis to enable students to address hypothesis-led biomedical research questions. This is a 4-year programme whose first year involves a series of taught modules and two laboratory-based research projects that lead to an MSc in Interdisciplinary Biomedical Research. The first two terms consist of a selection of taught modules that allow students to gain a solid grounding in multidisciplinary science. Students also attend a series of masterclasses led by academic and industry experts in areas of molecular, cellular and tissue dy... |
| Artificial intelligence applied to blood cancer diagnosis                                                                                     | The project will apply artificial intelligence to the diagnosis of blood cancers, principally non-Hodgkin lymphomas, which are cancers that cause substantial morbidity and early loss of life across the population. It is a collaboration between a University research group working in data science and artificial intelligence and the haematological diagnostic laboratory at St James University Hospital. It will employ genome sequence, gene expression and pathology image data for a substantial retrospective patient cohort to tackle a range of important diagnostic problems, including the transformation of indolent cancers to aggressive form, discovery of sub-groups where standard therapy fails and ... |
