# CrunchBase

Our analysis of startup activity in the intersection of AI and genomics relies on [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/), a widely database with information about just under 4.9 million technology organisations and startups and their investments. We have collected and stored all this data locally.

## Processing

Each CrunchBase company is assigned a set of category labels which we have explored in order to identify relevant categories for us. While there is an "Artificial Intelligence" category in the data, the closest category to genomics that we are able to find is "Genetics". We have found 26,059 organisations in the Artificial Intelligence category, 1,546 organisations in the Genetics category, and 51 companies in their intersection.

We complement this with a text analysis of organisations descriptions also available from CrunchBase, which are available for just under 50% of the companies in the data. What we do here is to concatenate "short" and "long" CrunchBase descriptions and search, within them, for terms related to AI ("artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "deep learning", "data science') and to Genomics ("genomic","genome"). This reveals 21,195 organisations with AI-related terms in their descriptions, and 1,736 organisations with genomics-related terms. We find 113 organisations in the intersection.

We have provisionally tagged with the "AI" and "Genomics" category any companies that are either labelled with relevant categories or have relevant terms in their descriptions. This yields a combined list of 34,345 AI organisations, 2,768 genetics or genomics organisations and 199 organisations in the intersection between both categories. We present the names and excerpts from the descriptions of 5 randomly drawn companies from each group.

These examples illustrates some of the opportunities and challenges in the CrunchBase data: while the AI genomics companies that we have identified look generally relevant (with the exception of HelloGov, where the use of the term "Social genome" trips up our string-matching method), company descriptions are in several cases short and lack the detail which might be required for an in-depth quantitative analysis vs what might be possible with article and patent abstracts. We note that the number of observations in the data are small enough for manual review and classification in themes.
